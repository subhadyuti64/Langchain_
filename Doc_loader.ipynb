The Problem: Why This Matters \\n India is witnessing a growing crisis of preventable blindness, primarily due to  diabetic \\n retinopathy, cataracts, and corneal diseases  . This  problem is aggravated by the \\n shortage of ophthalmologists and diagnostic infrastructure, especially in rural and \\n underserved regions. Early intervention is often the key to preserving sight, yet delayed \\n diagnoses are common. We aim to address this gap by proposing “  SightGuardian AI  ” — a \\n user-friendly AI-powered solution that can assist in early screening, support timely \\n treatment, and reduce avoidable blindness. \\n 2. Who We Aim to Help \\n Our solution targets community health workers, local diagnostic labs, and semi-urban or \\n rural clinics that lack specialist access. It also considers patients in remote areas who have \\n limited exposure to eye-care awareness or facilities. By creating a  low-cost, intelligent \\n and user-friendly screening tool  , we aim to enable early detection where it's needed the \\n most. \\n 3. Role of Generative AI in Our Approach \\n We propose using pre-trained  computer vision models  from Hugging Face to identify \\n signs of diabetic retinopathy, cataracts, or keratopathy from retinal images. The output will \\n be sent to a  RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)  model trained on past diagnostic \\n reports and relevant sources.  LangChain  will handle the  Retrieval  and  Large Language \\n Models  like GPT-4 or Gemini will do the  Generator  part. Visual aids like  Grad-CAM \\n highlight critical image regions, while models like  BLIP  can assist in generating \\n context-aware image captions, improving clinical transparency and interpretability. \\n 4. Solution Framework and Workflow \\n SightGuardian AI operates through the following framework designed for scalability and \\n accessibility: \\n ●  Image Upload & Preprocessing:  Users upload retinal  images via a mobile or web \\n interface, with enhancements like contrast adjustment and denoising to ensure \\n image quality. \\n ●  AI-Powered Condition Detection:  Pre-trained models  (EfficientNetB0, ResNet50, \\n ViT) analyze images for signs of diabetic retinopathy, cataracts, and keratopathy. \\n Visual aids like Grad-CAM and BLIP enhance transparency. \\n ●  Intelligent Report Generation:  A RAG+LLM model creates readable summaries \\n with severity, treatment suggestions, and preventive steps.\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Skia/PDF m137', 'creator': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/137.0.0.0 Safari/537.36', 'creationdate': '2025-06-15T12:25:53+00:00', 'title': 'SightGuardian AI - Google Docs', 'moddate': '2025-06-15T12:25:53+00:00', 'source': 'Debuggers_RohanDas_Jazzzee2025_Document.pdf', 'total_pages': 2, 'page': 1, 'page_label': '2'}, page_content='●  Advanced Clinical Guidance:  For complex cases, it provides surgical readiness \\n checklists and referral cues. \\n ●  Delivery & Integration:  Reports with visuals and recommendations are shared \\n through the app for immediate action. \\n 5. Feasibility and Execution Plan \\n We will utilize publicly available datasets such as  APTOS 2019  ,  EyePACS  , and  Messidor  to \\n evaluate the performance of pre-trained computer vision models hosted on Hugging Face. \\n These models minimize retraining efforts and ensure rapid prototyping. For the  backend  , \\n we will use  FastAPI  integrated with  LangChain  to connect CV outputs to a  RAG  system \\n trained on diagnostic data. GPT-4 or Gemini will then generate reports dynamically. The \\n frontend, built in  React.js  , will support image uploads and intuitive result presentation. \\n Cloud deployment ensures accessibility, scalability, and continuous iteration. \\n 6. Scalability and Potential Impact \\n SightGuardian AI is built for scalable deployment across India’s diverse healthcare \\n ecosystem. Its cloud-based infrastructure ensures it runs smoothly on both mobile and \\n desktop devices, making it adaptable for  rural clinics  ,  urban hospitals  , and \\n telemedicine networks  . Through partnerships with  local  clinics  ,  digital health \\n startups  , and  eye care NGOs  , the platform can reach  underserved populations quickly. Its \\n AI-generated reports empower frontline health workers to make timely, informed referrals. \\n In the long term, expert-driven updates and integration of new clinical data will keep the \\n system current and improve decision-making. Feedback loops from users will guide iterative \\n improvements, ensuring accuracy, safety, and local relevance. \\n 7. Summary and Vision Forward \\n SightGuardian AI offers a practical and accessible approach to early eye disease detection \\n using a  blend of computer vision and language models  . Its user-friendly interface, and \\n low-resource compatibility make it ideal for use across India’s healthcare settings. By \\n focusing on assistive, explainable AI, it simplifies clinical decision-making for frontline \\n workers and expands reach to populations often left out of traditional systems. Its design \\n emphasizes real-world usability and adaptability, making it a valuable, scalable solution that \\n supports national goals in vision care and public health. \\n “With SightGuardian AI, we envision a future where no one loses vision simply \\n because help came too late.” \\n Submitted By: \\n Team Debuggers: \\n 1.
