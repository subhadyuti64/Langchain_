      "Dost: Hi there! How can I help you today?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dost: Okay! Since you're in Puri and craving coffee, here are a few cafe suggestions, keeping in mind that Puri is primarily known for its traditional offerings and less for a vibrant cafe culture like you might find in a larger city:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Expectations:** Don't expect a huge range of specialty coffee drinks or trendy atmospheres like you might find in bigger cities.\n",
      "*   **Hotel Cafes:** Hotels often have the best and most consistent coffee and cafe-style food in Puri.\n",
      "*   **Local Cafes:** There will be small local cafes that primarily focus on tea and basic coffee. They might be more budget-friendly but less predictable in quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Here are some suggestions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Hotel Cafes (Generally the most reliable for quality):**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Mayfair Waves:** This luxury hotel usually has a nice cafe or restaurant where you can get a good cup of coffee. Check for breakfast or all-day dining options. It's one of the most upscale places in Puri.\n",
      "*   **Chanakya BNR Hotel:** Another good option with a restaurant that likely serves coffee and snacks. It has a reputation for good service.\n",
      "*   **Sterling Puri:** Located near the beach, this hotel's restaurant would be a reliable option for coffee.\n",
      "*   **Holiday Resort:** This is a popular hotel, and their in-house restaurants would likely serve coffee.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Independent Cafes and Restaurants:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Search on Google Maps for \"Cafe\" or \"Coffee Shop\" in Puri.** Use the filters on Google Maps to see ratings and reviews to help you narrow down the options. Read the recent reviews, especially ones that mention coffee quality, cleanliness, and atmosphere.\n",
      "*   **Ask Locals:** Don't hesitate to ask your hotel staff or any local person you encounter for their recommendation for a good coffee place. They might know of a hidden gem.\n",
      "\n",
      "**To help me narrow down the best suggestion for you, can you tell me:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **What kind of atmosphere are you looking for?** (e.g., quiet, lively, beachfront, budget-friendly, upscale)\n",
      "*   **Are you looking for food as well, or just coffee?**\n",
      "*   **Are you near a specific area in Puri?** (e.g., near the beach, near the Jagannath Temple, on Grand Road)\n",
      "*   **What's your budget like?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Once I have that information, I can give you a more tailored recommendation! Enjoy your coffee in Puri!\n",
      "\n",
      "Dost: Okay, if I had to pick the \"best\" one from the options I gave earlier, considering that \"best\" usually means a combination of reliable coffee quality, a comfortable atmosphere, and generally good service, I would recommend **Mayfair Waves** in Puri.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's why:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Reputation and Consistency:** Mayfair hotels are known for their quality and service. You're more likely to find a consistently good cup of coffee there compared to smaller, independent cafes.\n",
      "*   **Atmosphere:** It's generally a pleasant and well-maintained environment, which makes for a more enjoyable coffee-drinking experience.\n",
      "*   **Food Options:** Even if you just want coffee, Mayfair Waves is likely to have a wide range of food options if you decide you're hungry.\n",
      "* **Upscale** It offers a more luxurious experience than other options.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Price:** Mayfair Waves will likely be the most expensive option on the list.\n",
      "*   **Verify availability:** It's always a good idea to call ahead to confirm that their cafe or restaurant is open to non-guests and serving coffee at the time you plan to visit, especially during off-peak hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How to Proceed:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Search \"Mayfair Waves Puri\" on Google Maps.** This will give you their exact location and contact information.\n",
      "2.  **Call them.** Ask if their cafe or restaurant is open to non-guests, and if they are serving coffee. Also, inquire about their coffee menu.\n",
      "3.  **If it sounds good, head over!**\n",
      "\n",
      "While Mayfair Waves is likely the \"safest\" bet for a good coffee experience in Puri, remember that it will come at a premium price. If you're on a tighter budget, you might consider trying one of the other hotel restaurants, but my confidence in the quality of the coffee is highest with Mayfair Waves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dost: You're very welcome! I hope you enjoy your coffee at Mayfair Waves (or wherever you decide to go) in Puri. Have a great time! Let me know if there is anything else I can assist you with.\n",
